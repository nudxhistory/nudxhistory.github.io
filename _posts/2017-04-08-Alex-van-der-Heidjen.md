### On the cultural differences between living in France and the United States

So growing up in France, I'm sure you've heard the stereotypes about French people being assholes, and a lot of French people are anti-Semitic and Islamophobic, but its ironic because such a large portion of the French population is Muslim (Alex reported a number of over 40%, while a quick google search shows a number of around 10%). The upper-class, predominantly white population, they have a fear, for no good reason, of what they don't understand, and are basically racist. On the other hand, the oppressed Muslim population is anti-Semitic because of all the Jews in the upper-class population. People there are stuck in their ways, and I dunno, they're assholes I guess. 

Growing up in an international environment, you'll find that a lot of the people are non-PC, and I was a part of that. Before I came here, I'd use words that I no longer feel comfortable even mentioning now just in casual conversation. I would think to myself, oh, this doesn't affect anyone because I don't really mean it when I say it. It can't offend anyone because I don't mean it to offend anyone. 

But honestly that shows a lack of tolerance, a lack of empathy, and I realized through my interactions with DX, the things occurring with sexual assault allegations on campus, and observing all the things happening around the recent US election, makes you realize, oh shit, I'm being an asshole as well. Just because you don't mean to hurt someone doesn't mean that you don't hurt them. 

Recently, in a conversation I was having with a girl, she was saying things like "oh, you're such a pussy," to which I responded with something about how I don't think she should be saying those things. Her response basically was like, you can't talk about these things because you're not a girl, and you wouldn't understand. But just because I'm not something doesn't mean I can't try and understand. 

### On choosing his major

One of the main reasons I chose anthropology is because with everything happening, it made me really interested in why people behave the way they do, because I like to think that no one is a bad person at heart. Like with the saying "assume best intentions," I really think that's true because obviously you don't know everyone's background, how they feel, how they were raised, so I don't think it's fair to really judge them.
